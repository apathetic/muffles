		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>how tired am i really?</p>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles<br />
		Why did my cat poo on my bed?<br />
		Love,<br />Chloe</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Well now! What a delightfully refreshing thing your
		cat did! You should be so happy that he/she/it decided to show you some attention.
		I know I would be excited if someone pooped on my bed. I'm sure your cat just likes
		you extra special.<br />
		Love,<br />

		Le Chat</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Le Chat,<br />
		Wow! What funny looking writing your question has! Funny words are hard for
		me, being just a cat and all. But if I had to try to answer I'd say: "Les
		questions de sexualité sont indicatif d'un problème d'identité. Probablement, t'as
		subi une perte de désir, ou l'insécurité sexuelle...peut-être à cause du climat
		incestueux." Meow!<br />
		Merci,<br />

		<p><span class="A">A</span>My, that's a hard question! After thinking really

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>what do you do for fun?<br />Tobias</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Tobias, <br/>
		Thank you for your kind question. As you are surely aware, cats are too serious
		to have "fun". Too serious and, at the same time, too cute. Meow!
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Will Chelsey have fun tonight?
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Ha Ha! I guess it depends on whether or not Chelsey is
		a fun-loving gal! Because you had to ask, I'd probably say no, no she won't. Which is sad.

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Catholics tend to take it easy, but Protestants are pushy. Why is that?  Jason</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Jason, <br />
		Cat-a-holics are really great people. They are people who really like cats.
		That's why they are generally relaxed and are fun to be around. I don't think Protestants like
		cats very much. So, it is easy to see why they are pushy and by nature probably not very
		fun to be around. I hope that answers your question!<br />
		Sincerely,<br />
		Muffles

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Will I have a great birthday party for my 30th anniversary?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>I'm just a cat, but I guess it depends on if your birthday happens to
		fall on the same date as your anniversary. If so, then no, probably not.</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>what is a dog</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>A dog is a big smelly animal that is not so very smart and has questionable
		hygiene. Oh, and they are not very cute at all.

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>What is Charlie Sheen's favorite color?
		<p><span class="A">A</span>My, what a difficult question. It's true that I don't know colours so well, but
		if I had to guess, I would say that it is some sort of sheen of charcoal.

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>What is the best way to tell someone No.</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-so,<br />
		Lots of hissing and scratching.<br />
		Good luck,<br />
		Muffles
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>What kind of cat(?) are you?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Ha ha, it is a very good question! Well, to answer,
		let me just say that I am a <i>cute</i> cat!</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Hey Muffles, is everything really subjective?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Your question goes right to the heart of solipsism. If we consider
		one's own experience to form the basis of their worldview, then another's experiences can only
		be inferred by analogy. Objective reality is not necessarily an impossibility in this instance,
		yet in considering it as such you are implicitly rejecting any knowledge based on experiences
		external to your own mind.<br />
		You're reading this, aren't you?<br />
		Now do you understand?<br />

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Justin asks, why do you not like dogs</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-so,<br />
		Please tell Justin that dogs are big and dumb and smelly. Anyone who likes
		dogs is probably big and dumb and smelly, too. Haven't you noticed?
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br />
		Do you really need to wait 5 seconds before you open the microwave door? <br />
		Thanks very much,<br />
		Tippi Hedren</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dearest Tippi,<br />
		My, what a curious question! To answer, I'd say, "of course not!". The faster you
		open the door, the faster you can have warmed cat food. Doesn't that sound nice?<br />
		Meow!
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br />
		I heard that eating aspartame causes anal leakage?  Is this true? <br />
		sincerely,<br />
		concerned diet dr pepper drinker</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>
		Well, let me see. It's good to be concerned if you're a diet Dr. Pepper drinker,
		Mr. diet dr pepper drinker. However, you sound like a person who worries a lot.
		That gives you wrinkles. Personally, I would just stop thinking about all those
		nasty, troubling thoughts and just do whatever feels good. That's what cats do.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Hi Muffles - long time no see!
		I was just wondering . . . would you rather be a unicorn for a day (with all the magical powers included) OR sing like your
		favorite singer forever. <br />
		Sincerely, <br />
		Moxi Fruvous</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>
		Aw, that's a terribly hard question! You mean I can't be a cat and have to choose one? Well, while singing like my favorite singer
		(Cat Stevens) forever certainly sounds appealing, I'd have to choose neither and stay a cat. Thanks for your question!
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Muffles, What is the most polluting country in the world?<br />-Kathryn</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Kathryn,
		Well, I don't know about countries &#8212; I am a cat after all, but my owner is always making a funny smell with her
		bum. It certainly pollutes the environment around here, let me tell you. <br />
		Sincerely,<br />
		Muffles</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>julie wants to know if phantex is good the environment.</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-so,<br />
		That's a funny question! Phantex certainly sounds good to me. But what about the environment? I fixed the punctuation in
		your sentence so that it makes sense to me. (But I am a cat after all!) <br /><i>"julie" wants to know if: phantex is good!
		the environment!</i> <br />Ha ha! Yes, the environment.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>what will the weather be like tomorrow?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Ha! Ha! What a funny question! It's always 21 degrees inside, where I live.<br />
		Best wishes,<br />
		Muffles
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>why don't you wake up?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-so,<br />
		I am a Cat. I like to sleep for much of the day. It is very hard work being a Cat. I also like tuna.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>what is the meaning of life</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Well! Let me just say that your statement is incorrect. "What" is not the
		meaning of life. For a cat, eating and sleeping is. I am a cat and I like to eat and sleep a lot. Ha!
		Ha! Isn't that funny?
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Does John love me?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>No. Because love for humans is an illusion. Schopenhaeur claimed that falling in love
		is the result of a "blind biological urge" in us. It is this basic instinct that binds men and women together &#8212;
		hence the illusionary nature of love. While many believe (falsely) that love is magical, sweet, sensational and is a
		symbol of happiness, Schopenhauer believed that the truth is ugly: marriage is a trap to confine couples together, while
		living as a husband and wife means you sacrifice your rights in exchange for double the duties.

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Hi muffles,<br />Yannikc has a question : Can you answer it?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-so,<br />
		Yes. I am very good at answering questions. I am also a very pretty cat.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Hi, Doggy wants to know what "arf" means.</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Doggy,<br />
		ARF could be one of several things. Most commonly arf, or A.R.F., is an acronym used to refer to:
		Acute renal failure, Acute respiratory failure, or Acute rheumatic fever. Do you see a pattern here?
		Me, neither. Thanks for your question. Meow!
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>my name is Cheri. How do cats purr?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Cheri,<br />
		Well! It is a very good question. Basically, we go like this (makes purring sound). Do you see? I close my eyes and
		(makes purring sound) and that is how cats purr.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>hi muffles,<br />
		sometimes i pick my nose and eat it when no one is looking, but maybe there is someone looking that i just can't see!
		i am worried, but i don't want to stop picking and eating my nose. what should i do??<br />
		Me.</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Me,<br />
		That's easy. Stop caring what other people think. I certainly don't (you included).	<br />
		Best wishes,<br />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Aidan wants to know why her back hurts?
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Aidan-in-the-3rd-person,<br />
		Let me just say it is probably because you are old and wrinkly. I just can't imagine a healthy human having a sore back.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Hi muffles,<br />
		do you ever answer any questions?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-So,<br />
		Well, I love answering questions. But I sleep so much that sometimes it seems like it takes me a long time. Humans are so impatient.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Hi Muffles,<br />
		will I one day own a Bentley car?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-So,<br />
		Ha ha! Cats don't know the future. But since you seem worrying and insecure, I'd say no. No, you won't.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>What are you?<br />
		Michael</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Michael,<br />
		Well, now! Is it not obvious? I am a cat! And I am the cutest cat! Ha ha! Sometimes people can be so silly. You're silly, Micheal.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Which are better in the eyes of the lord: cats are pigeons?<br />
		Love: Space Camp</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Space Camp,<br />
		Thank you for you nice letter. First, let me help you a little bit: cats are not pigeons! You can tell because cats (like me) are cute and meow,
		while pigeons stink and eat garbage. And also: neither are better in the eyes of the lord! That's silly! If the lord's eyes hurt, maybe he can
		put eye-drops in instead.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>What are your favorite rap artists?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-So,<br />
		That's easy! None! They all hurt my cat ears. I prefer meow-ing.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles<br />
		Is it good manners to offer beers to your friends when they visit?<br />
		Yours, Beerless</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Beerless,<br />
		No, cats don't drink beer! They drink water and sometimes milk. If I had some milk to give my cat friends, though, I still wouldn't offer it.
		It's mine.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />
		Why do people not understand there is no god and death is just the end.<br />
		From: Reality</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Reality,<br />
		The existential reality you address is commonly called atheism. This practice rejects all other theisms and proffers that God does not exist.
		Now, when you speak of "understanding", perhaps you refer to how widespread this practice is in an ever-increasing agnostic population? For example,
		a member of a mono- or a polytheistic belief would perhaps understand death to only be the beginning, while an atheist would understand the opposite.
		Understanding&#8212;in the particular instance you raise above&#8212;is then just a function of how prevalent a particular belief system is in our society.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Are there any other muffles?<br />
		The other muffles</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear the other muffles, <br />
		No.<br />
		Best wishes,<br />
		Muffles
		</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>What should I eat?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Well, now! I think I've addressed this question before! Why not read the
		thoughtful, insightful and witty information herein first and perhaps you could learn a thing or two?<br />
		</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>shall i dump shannon and ask nicky to go out with me<br />
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear "  " <br />
		Well, what an interesting dilemma! From how you've described her, it certainly sounds like Nicky
		is an attractive, intelligent and caring young girl. But why break up with Shannon, a creative, loving, and
		funny human female? She sounds really terrific. I say keep Shannon and ask Nicky out as well. I have all sorts of tomcats that I'm partial to, why not keep them all?<br />
		Sincerely,<br />
		Muffles

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />
		If you arouse a monster, do you call that "cock monster?"<br />
		Love,</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear ,<br />
		Well, seeing as I'm just a nice cat I've never aroused a cock monster (or any monster for that matter).
		But I suppose that if I did I would call it "Roger" or "John Thomas". Meow meow!<br />
		Thanks for your nice letter.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>	Dear Muffles,<br />
		Should I have someone design nice eyebrows for me? <br />
		What if they do something not pretty !?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So-and-So,<br />
		What do you mean "design nice eyebrows"? I didn't realize it was possible to engage in such a mundane task
		such as designing eyebrows. You humans are allll so simple-minded. Why not shave all the hair off of your
		head and never worry about it again? I'm sure you'll still be pretty.<br />
		Sincerely, <br />
		Muffles<br />
		P.S. I meant pretty <i>ugly</i>.</p>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />
		What is your favorite constellation? <br />

		deSiRe
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear deSiRe, <br />
		What an silly question. Please!<br />
		Sincerely, <br />

		P.S.  What's a constellation?</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Is it wrong if they don't match? Like, if one's bigger than the other and is a slightly different color? Is it weird for guys to see that, and then, um, go ahead and touch them anyway?<br />
		Sincerely,<br />
		I'm Talking About My Socks Pervert</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear I'm Talking About My Socks Pervert,<br />
		Oh my, what a funny name you have. How ever did you come about it? You must certainly like talking about socks. Do you think
		this implies an unnatural interest in superficial and trivial elements in your life, perhaps? You remind me of my cat-friend Cannot-Stop-Licking-Himself, who, interestingly, couldn't
		stop licking himself. But why the "pervert"? Clearly, you are a pervert who likes socks...and has a foot fetish perhaps? As a cat, this
		is really strange for me to understand, but my owner sometimes massages strangers' feet so I am used to it. Humans are so strange.<br />
		Cautious regards,<br />
		Muffles</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />Is Jesus gay, or is it just me? I mean, come on! He's got long hair and whatnot.<br />
		Why does everyone from the South Shore speak like they're from Goodfellas?<br />
		Come on!<br />Love you Muffles.<br />So and so.</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear So and so, <br />Well! That's very amazing! Usually it is very rare for a cat to meet a human with the
		kind of insight you've displayed! Yes, the one you call "Jesus" is indeed gay. You can tell because he also wears a dress.<br />
		Now, to answer your second question about everyone from the South Shore. Well, let me just say that yes, they do speak like
		they are good fellows!<br />
		Sincerely, <br />
		Muffles

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>I live in a foreign country and I have few friends...and I feel uninspired to make art...can you help
		me Muffles? <br />Your friend, deSiRe</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear deSiRe, <br />Well, I hardly know how a cat could help you make art. But don't worry &#8212; feeling
		lazy and uninspired is perfectly normal. Most of us feel this way our entire lives, and to feel any different is, well, wrong. So
		I say to you: stop worrying and whining about being lazy. Just accept it! When everyone sees how much more relaxed you are as a
		result, you're sure to win more friends. Meow!<br />

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffler, <br />I need a new muffler for winter. What fabric should I get to make one?
		Should I get a cat hair muffler? <br />Signed, <br />Muffy</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Muffy, <br />Oh, dear! How horrible! Poor humans get so cold in the winter. Luckily,
		cats don't have that problem. Instead of getting a muffler, why don't you just stay inside until June? You sound like
		the kind of person who has trouble making decisions, so I hope that helps.<br />Sincerely, <br />Muffles</p>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br />Have you seen the musical "CATS"?  If so, what were your impressions of

		theatre?<br />Yours, <br />Pickles</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Pickles, <br />Ha ha! That's sure a lot of big, funny words! Well, to answer your funny

		Mao? Don’t you mean "meow"? Ha ha ha ha.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Muffles, who am I?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>To ask who am I is to delve into the depth of the human ego. There are 2 other components
		which comprise human behaviour, according to Freud. The Id and the Superego. Together these 3 make up a meow mix of
		personality. I’d say you were about 90 percent Id, 3 percent Ego and 12 percent Super ego.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />
		What is your sixth sense? Do I have six senses?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear so and so,<br />
		Thanks for asking, I would say that my sixth sense is cuteness.  Unfortunately, humans only have 3 senses &#8212; one of
		them allows you to see dead people.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Gosh Muffles, how did you get so darned cute?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Tee hee, thanks for your purrfect question.  Well let me just say that I'm a cat.

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span> Muffles, I love you! I want to take you and stroke your inner thighs all day! Do you
      	like that?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear so and so, oh how nice! But cats don’t have thighs, so they certainly don’t have
		inner thighs! But your sentiment is very sweet. Thank you for your letter.

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />
		If you went to Jeans! Jeans! Jeans! and saw a sign that said "buy one get one
		free" and they were really nasty golf shorts that were buy one get one free,
		would you buy one pair to get the other pair free? Just thinking about the
		summer bargains and whatnot.<br />
		Thanks Muffles, you're so cute!<br />
		Signed,<br />
		Sasquatch<br /></p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Sasquatch,<br />
		No.<br />
		Sincerely,<br />
		Muffles<br /></p>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br />If you went camping with your buddies and woke up in the
		morning hungover with your pants around your ankles, grass-stains on your knees, a used condom hanging
		from your ass, and no memory of the nights events, would you tell anyone?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Ha ha! That's a silly question! Cats don't go camping!</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br />How is it that the circumference of an ant's circumcision
		is not the same as that of an elephants, relatively speaking?<br />Signed,<br />Big Fan!</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear Big Fan, I'm not sure what you're talking about exactly &#8212; it's all very
		confusing for a cat &#8212; but I guess it is because ants and elephants are not the same, relatively speaking.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br />What should I eat for dinner?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Good question! This is the best question ever! Let me say that I think about this
		subject often, for much of the day. After sleeping on the matter, and pondering it, I generally come to the conclusion that
		I will eat...whatever my owner gives me. Meow!</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br /> What do you think I should do?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Dear anonymous, well to ask "what should I do" is to delve into the depths of the human
		psyche. There are those of us who believe that one's actions reflect the nature of their beliefs, whereas others would
		argue that our actions are alien to one's experiences. Kirkegaard posits that true knowledge is gained through one's
		experiences, thus "doing" contributes to one's truth.  Now I ask you stranger, what do you think I think you should do?</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles, <br />Should I go to the water slides even if it's cold and raining?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Cats don't like the cold and the rain, or the water for that matter.  Why not stay inside
		and watch TV even if it's sunny? Meow meow Meow.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />Does it make me a slut if I did a line of coke off a hard cock... without a
		straw?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Drinking soda off a chicken? I don't understand why that would make you a slut. Anyway, cats
		prefer the term "queen" &#8212; that's a female cat.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />Are you sleeping, or just too wise to open your eyes all the way?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Well, let me just say that cats are the wisest of all the animals. I never open my eyes when
		I'm sleeping. That's silly!</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />How much?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Oh my! How much...what? How much love is there in Muffles' heart, perhaps? Well,
		there is lots and lots of love in my heart! Enough for everyone, everywhere! (except the Jews).</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />Is 14 old enough?</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Why, thank you for your kind letter! Meeeeow! In answer to your lovely question: 14 in cat years
		is like 110, so yes! In fact, 14 is way too old!</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span class="Q">Q</span>Dear Muffles,<br />can cats get herpes?<br /> Sincerely, Bob</p>
		<p><span class="A">A</span>Hi Bob! Ha ha! That's a funny question!</p>
