  "Q": "Does John love me?",

    hence the illusionary nature of love. While many believe (falsely) that love is magical, sweet, sensational and is a
    symbol of happiness, Schopenhauer believed that the truth is ugly: marriage is a trap to confine couples together, while
    living as a husband and wife means you sacrifice your rights in exchange for double the duties."

{
  "Q": "Dear Muffles,\n
    Why do people not understand there is no god and death is just the end.\n
    From: Reality",
  "A": "Dear Reality,\n
    The existential reality you address is commonly called atheism. This practice rejects all other theisms and proffers that God does not exist.
    Now, when you speak of \"understanding\", perhaps you refer to how widespread this practice is in an ever-increasing agnostic population? For example,
    a member of a mono- or a polytheistic belief would perhaps understand death to only be the beginning, while an atheist would understand the opposite.
    Understanding&#8212;in the particular instance you raise above&#8212;is then just a function of how prevalent a particular belief system is in our society."

  "A": "Dear I'm Talking About My Socks Pervert,\n
    Oh my, what a funny name you have. How ever did you come about it? You must certainly like talking about socks. Do you think
    this implies an unnatural interest in superficial and trivial elements in your life, perhaps? You remind me of my cat-friend Cannot-Stop-Licking-Himself, who, interestingly, couldn't
    stop licking himself. But why the \"pervert\"? Clearly, you are a pervert who likes socks...and has a foot fetish perhaps? As a cat, this
    is really strange for me to understand, but my owner sometimes massages strangers' feet so I am used to it. Humans are so strange.\n

  "Q": "Muffles, who am I?",
  "A": "To ask who am I is to delve into the depth of the human ego. There are 2 other components
    which comprise human behaviour, according to Freud. The Id and the Superego. Together these 3 make up a meow mix of

},
{
  "Q": "Dear Muffles, \n What do you think I should do?",
  "A": "Dear anonymous, well to ask \"what should I do\" is to delve into the depths of the human
    psyche. There are those of us who believe that one's actions reflect the nature of their beliefs, whereas others would
    argue that our actions are alien to one's experiences. Kirkegaard posits that true knowledge is gained through one's
    experiences, thus \"doing\" contributes to one's truth.  Now I ask you stranger, what do you think I think you should do?"
},
{
